shadow is always cast on the z=0 plane from the positive z direction

top of the file should have the format:
- a list of point light sources to simulate a diffuse light source
  - first line is exactly: 'lights section:\n'
  - then the lights are specified one per line in lines that look like:
    '0.02, 0.01, 1.0\n'
	where these numbers are the x, y, and z coordinates respectively.
- one empty line ('\n')
- the radius of the bar stock in a line of the form 'radius= 0.02\n'
- a rectangular region of interest on the z=0 plane in a line that looks like:
  'region= -1.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0\n'
  where the four numbers are the minimum x, maximum x, minumum y, and maximum y values
  respectively in the rectangular region.
- the width and height, in pixels, of the image to map to the region of interest in
  a line that looks like: 'resolution= 3000,3000\n'

then there must be an empty lined

body of the file is:
- a list of strands of metal, separated by empty lines and terminated by a pair of
  blank lines
