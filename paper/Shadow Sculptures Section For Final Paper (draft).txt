Each of Larry Kagan's sculptures consists of a metal structure composed of bent rods of metal mounted to a wall and illuminated by a bright light from a carefully chosen location. The eye is drawn to the shadow produced this way, which forms a familiar image, while the rods themselves often have no obvious pattern. In the simplest case, the shadow image is a line drawing and the rods are attached to the wall at several points. For example, the piece "Frankfurt Chair" is like this. Kagan has created many variations on this idea including incorporating some of the bent rods in the recognizable image while most of the image is formed by the shadow, as seen in "Beach Chair". "Intersection of Two Circles" shows that a sculpture composed of rods can have a solid shadow with a geometric shape. [NOTE: It would be good to talk about the @ sign sculpture. It shows that the light source can be far off to one side of the sculpture.] Despite the fact that a single small bright light source is installed to cast the shadow for each sculpture, soft egdes of the shadow are noticeable in many of these works. In "Mosquito I", Kagan uses this effect in a dramatic way; the image present in the shadow of this sculpture is a mosquito with its own shadow cast by an imaginary light source. In order to make the distinction obvious, Kagan allowed soft shadow edges to show in the portion of the image corresponding to the imaginary shadow of the mosquito, but created the image of the mosquito with dark hard-edged shadows.
