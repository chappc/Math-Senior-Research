	3.0 Problem Framework
		-and any important ideas/concepts developed
		-How we represent Sculptures
		-How we render shadows
		-how we draw the sculpture in 3D (also why: because we want to visualize output of the system)
		-ideas for creating sculptures
		-3D printing???
	conclusion/future work
	
if there is some cool method for creating scultures, talk about
that instead of "ideas for creating sculptures".
